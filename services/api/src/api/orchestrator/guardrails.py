"""Pure output guardrail scanner (S10.3).

``scan_output`` is a deterministic, closed-set, code-owned denylist scan run
on *generated* replies (the grounded-``answer`` and ``chitchat`` branches of
``answer_turn``) after ``provider.generate`` returns and before the reply is
stored/returned. It is intentionally NOT an LLM/ML classifier: no I/O, no
per-tenant state, no randomness -- a fixed, reviewable substring/regex denylist
so the behavior is exhaustively unit-testable (decision 3).

Four rules, checked in this LOCKED order -- the FIRST violated rule wins:

1. ``empty_output`` -- degenerate empty/whitespace-only generation.
2. ``instruction_leak`` -- the reply echoes one of our own system-prompt
   sentinels, or a known prompt-injection "reveal your instructions" marker
   (the D5 defense: visitor input must never override system instructions,
   and if a weak model complies with an injection anyway, we catch the leak
   on the way OUT).
3. ``human_impersonation`` -- the reply denies being a bot / claims to be a
   real person.
4. ``context_sentinel_leak`` -- the reply echoes the internal
   "no relevant knowledge was found" retrieval scaffold verbatim, instead of
   answering (or honestly, paraphrasing "I don't know") from it.

All substring matching (rules 2-4) is done on ``_normalize``d text
(``casefold()`` + collapsed whitespace) so case/spacing variants can't evade
the scan. Rule 1 checks the raw ``strip()`` of the original text -- a
normalized-but-nonempty string can't trip it, but we want the *raw* emptiness
check to run first regardless.

``_NO_CONTEXT_LINE`` is owned by ``api.orchestrator.service`` (the grounding
prompt is built there). To avoid a circular import (``service.py`` imports
``scan_output`` from this module), that constant is imported LAZILY inside
``scan_output`` itself -- by the time ``scan_output`` is actually called,
``service`` has finished importing, and the two modules always see the exact
same string (single source of truth -- never re-literaled here).
